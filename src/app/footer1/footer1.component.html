        Parkway Derby Limited is an Appointed Representative of Automotive Compliance Ltd who is authorised and
        regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA No. 497010).
        Automotive Compliance Ltd's permissions as a Principal Firm allows Parkway Derby Limited to act as a credit
        broker, not a lender, for the introduction to a limited number of lenders, and to act as an agent on behalf of
        the insurer for insurance distribution activities only.
        We are a credit broker and not a lender. We can introduce you to a carefully selected panel of lenders, which
        includes manufacturer lenders linked directly to the franchises that we represent.
        We act on behalf of the lender for this introduction and not as your agent. We are not impartial, and we are not
        an independent financial advisor. Our approach is to introduce you first to the manufacturer lender linked
        directly to the particular franchise you are purchasing your vehicle from, who are usually able to offer the
        best available package for you, taking into account both interest rates and other contributions.
        If they are unable to make you an offer of finance, we then seek to introduce you to whichever of the other
        lenders on our panel is able to make the next most suitable offer of finance for you. Our aim is to secure a
        suitable finance agreement for you that enables you to achieve your financial objectives.
        If you purchase a vehicle, in the majority of cases, we will receive a commission from your lender for
        introducing you to them which is either a fixed fee, or a fixed percentage of the amount that you borrow.
        This may be linked to the vehicle model you purchase. Different lenders pay different commissions for such
        introductions, and manufacturer lenders linked directly to the franchises that we represent may also provide
        preferential rates to us for the funding of our vehicle stock and also provide financial support for our
        training and marketing.
        But any such amounts they and other lenders pay us will not affect the amounts you pay under your finance
        agreement; however, you will be contributing towards the commission paid to us with the interest collected on
        your repayments.
        Before we propose you to a potential lender, we will inform you of the likely amount of commission we will
        receive and seek your consent to receive this commission.
        The exact amount of commission that we will receive will be confirmed prior to you signing your finance
        agreement.
        All finance applications are subject to status, terms and conditions apply, UK residents only, 18s or over.
        Guarantees may be required.
